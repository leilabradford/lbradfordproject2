			This affects the environment because many people go through tragic events, no matter what age or gender.
			If exposed to abuse it can lead to long-lasting physical, mental, and emotional harm, whether the child is a direct victim or a witness. 
			Kids exposed to violence are more likely to suffer severe effects which include: an extended period of stress and/or depression. 
			Even though men may be a victim of this the majority of them are women.
			1 out of 3 women has been forced to have sex, hit/beaten, and or abused in another way. Often by someone they know, which includes her husband or another male family member. 
			If in an abusive environment you need to get out as fast as you can. In the environment where you got sick at you will not heal in it.
			"Children who witness domestic violence or are victims of abuse themselves are at serious risk for long-term physical and mental health problems." 
			Women who may be victims of this are at a greater risk of mental health problems, such as depression and psychotic symptoms.
